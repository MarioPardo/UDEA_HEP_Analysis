1) Connect to remote server via ssh
    ssh username@serverip

2)Go into the required folder, in this case its PhenoTools/MC_Samples/
    Do this using cd command 

3)Start Jupyter notebook
    using the command: jupyter notebook

4) Inspect output for port number.
    Something like: 
        [I 2024-08-09 10:43:19.956 ServerApp] Jupyter Server 2.14.2 is running at:
        [I 2024-08-09 10:43:19.956 ServerApp] http://localhost:8888/tree?token=51088cff595f9e6446ebf8867cadde7ff50de145f715b9ee


    here our port number is 8888

5) Port forward from local machine.
    On local machine, in a new terminal window, use the command
    ssh -L portnumber:localhost:portnumber username@serverip
    for example: ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 joseruiz@181.118.159.243

6) On a web broser, paste the http://localhost address from above

7) Sometimes it will ask for token, which is in said address
